The file has a codec. It is part of the metadata of the file. From the metadata it is possible to know which part of the file to read when seeking. The OS has this fearure to allow from reading from any mid point of the file. Once the part is read from the memory, it is sent to the IO device. But this needs to happen at the right speed.

In that case, you can put the read bytes on the accelerator and the the pixels on the outside
