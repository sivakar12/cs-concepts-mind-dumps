# CS Concepts Mind Dumps

An experimental style of writing where I try to dump everything in 
my mind about random topics. This is a free flow of ideas with no
structure or organization which can be written quickly - I usually
set a timer for ten minutes and do it like brainstorming. These are
not accurate and I guess how things work a lot here.
